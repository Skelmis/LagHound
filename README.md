# Lag-Hound
A tool for automating the discovery and exploitation of time based user enumeration.


## Design Goals

1. Provide the ability to test for time based user enumeration with sufficient evidence for pentest reports
2. Provide functionality such that given a known useer format one can build a list of valid users on a given site
3. Be a rad piece of tooling
